## [Unreleased (1.1.0)]

- Changes `Protos::Dropdown` and `Protos::Popover` to use a hidden `div` instead
  of `template` to contain content. Rack test does not load any html from
  template elements which forces tests that would otherwise be fine to have to
  load javascript.
- Improves how tables print by breaking after or before rows instead of within.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-03-01

- Fixes a bug with inherited classes not finding their defined keys

- Updates to Phlex `v2`

  overhead of this completely unused feature. This removes `dry-core` as
  a dependency

## [0.7.0] - 2025-01-13

- Changes passing an `input_id` to accordions. Replaced with the more accurate
  `input_name` (optional) parameter. There was no point in having different
  name attributes for the different radio buttons
- Updates modal component to use newer modal controller from protos-stimulus
  that uses `@stimulus-components/dialog`
- Adds the ability for `css` helper to take multiple values, including inline
  values instead of theme keys.

- Removes deprecated tokens to prepare for phlex 2.0
- Removes `dry-initializer` undefined constant to improve performance
- Adds autoloading constants instead of hard requires

## [0.6.0] - 2024-09-04

- Changes how merging attributes works to only mix on certain attributes,
  overriding on all others. This is opposite to how attributes used to be merged
  by default. This is a fix for attributes like `value` where you actually need
  to override them.
- Adds a separate tested `Mix` class for handling attribute merging

## [0.5.0] - 2024-08-27

- Fixes all accessibility violations according to Axe Core

  performance
- Improvements to performance with constant hash lookups and early returns on
  `mix`
- Adds steps component

## [0.4.0] - 2024-04-09

- Phlex discord didn't like all the calls to `render`
- Apparently `render` is called differently within ERB
- Suggested to change all calls to immediately render, would improve ergonomics

## [0.3.0] - 2024-04-06

- Updates to phlex v0.10 by changing all `template` methods to `view_template`

## [0.2.0] - 2024-03-06
